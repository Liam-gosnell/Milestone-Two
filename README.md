<p>Stream Two Project: Interactive Frontend Development - Code Institute<p>

<p> This is a website based on my idea of a car review wesbite.
This website showcases Car reviews, Images, Blog posts and a contact form with google maps api.

# UX

<h2>User stories</h2>

<p>As an automotive enthusiast I expect to see News/Reviews and Images of cars</p>
<p>As a person looking for Information on vehicles I expect a contact form to send questions</p>

<h2>Strategy</h2>
<p>My goal in the design was to make it easy as possible to locate and access information on the site.
I added some simple animations to make the website more interactive. 
The color scheme was picked to create a nice but simple contrast to give the website a modern feel. </p>


<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>For the Atomotive enthusiasts, I wanted to provide them with an overview of what my opion is on cars . All the information they need 
is right infront of them, with the option to contact me if they had a question. </p>

<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>In all the sections, I wanted everything to be simple and easy to find. My layout was easy to follow and effective, 
by having 5 clear sections that had exact purposes. </p>


<h2>Skeleton</h2>
